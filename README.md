# **NextJS simple app**

## HOW TO RUN PROJECT:

`npm run dev`

`npm run server`

## Notes

1. a static introduction page with revalidation interval (e.g. 5 min); - no idea what to fetch and revalidate on the main page.
2. Consider hiding real back-end API endpoints. - I know that to hide a real API we can choose nextJS API Routes or create a PROXY Server, but in the app, I decided to use fake-json-server
